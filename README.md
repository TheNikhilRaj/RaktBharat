# RaktBharat Website

A responsive, accessible landing page designed to work smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Features

- Mobile-first, responsive layout with semantic sections
- Accessible navigation with a hamburger menu on small screens
- Smooth scrolling, active link highlighting, and section fade-ins
- Lazy-loaded images and reduced-motion support
- Simple, clean typography and spacing for friendly usability

## Quick Start

Open `index.html` directly in your browser. No build step required.

## Development

- HTML: `index.html`
- Styles: `styles.css`
- Scripts: `script.js`
- Assets: `Assets/`

## Testing Tips

- Use browser DevTools responsive mode to check breakpoints (e.g., 360px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px).
- Toggle the mobile menu using the hamburger button; ensure links close the menu after navigation.
- If you prefer reduced motion, enable it in your OS; animations will be minimized.

## Notes

- Image placeholders can be replaced with real assets in `Assets/`.
- Donation and sign-in are placeholders; wire them to backend when ready.
